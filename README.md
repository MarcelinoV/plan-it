Program that opens city weather and google map using openweather map.

Openweathermap is a service that provides weather data, including current weather data, forecasts, and historical data to the developers of web services and mobile applications.

It provides an API with JSON, XML and HTML endpoints and a limited free usage tier.

I use this API to provide weather data to my program for it to function. Read comments within code to understand thought process.
